## How to Use This

1. **Name the feeling** — locate yourself in a family
2. **Ask the inquiry** — not to answer intellectually, but to *feel into*
3. **Discover the value** — what emerges is what matters to you
4. **Honor it** — the feeling is a messenger; the value is the message

*Feelings aren't problems to solve. They're information about what you care about.*
